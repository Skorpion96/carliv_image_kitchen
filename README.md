The idea behind this fork is one: being able to run Carliv Image Kitchen Systemlessly and not being forced everytime to go search for it on it's folder.

I was tired of going to look for Carliv folder on my pc and so i edited it to work hidden on my home directory and be able to run from terminal easily. 

To use this fork you have to clone the repo, put the cloned folder on your home directory or where you like, then edit the symlink which is in reality a script to run carliv accordingly to the path where you will put carliv.

In case you will put it on your home directory as on the symlink script replace $USER with your username and rename carliv folder accordingly. That's all.
